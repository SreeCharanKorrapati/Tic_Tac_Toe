# Tic_Tac_Toe
A 3x3 grid Tic Tac Toe game using Python. Until one player lines up three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or until all of the cells are filled without a winning combination being achieved by either player, a tie will result, the players take turns placing either X or O in one of the open cells on the grid.
